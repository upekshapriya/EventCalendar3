EventCalendar3
================

Event Calendar 3 Wordpress plugin by Alex Tingle updated to work with Wordpress 3.8

**About**

Manage future events as an online calendar. Display upcoming events in a dynamic calendar, on a listings page, or as a list in the sidebar. You can subscribe to the calendar from iCal (OSX), Sunbird or Google calendar.

Choose one WordPress category as the ‘event’ category, and then add posts for dates in the future. Add the calendar or event list functions to your template, or just use the ‘Event Category’ page to list your forthcoming events.

EventCalendar3 works fine with WordPress 3.8. 

**History**

EventCalendar was originally a simple WordPress 1 plugin by ‘Kitten’ (at <http://blog.mookitty.co.uk>) who released it as GPL. Alex Tingle took it and heavily edited it, changed it to use WordPress’ (then) new hooks, and released it as EventCalendar2.

EventCalendar3 was a complete rewrite by [Alex Tingle](http://blog.firetree.net "Event Calendar website"). It uses none of Kitten’s original code. The original work on the new EventCalendar was partially sponsored by Stephen Hinton. Many members of the EventCalendar [mailing list](http://penguin.firetree.net/eventcalendar) have contributed code, testing and bug fixes. Special thanks to…
